# Java Programming: Arrays, Lists & Structured Data
My notes and code produced when going through [Duke University Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data/)

## Week 1
[StringBuilder Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html)

Continuation on String theory and introduction of Counting Loop with it's parts:
1. Initialization (happens once, before guard)
2. Guard, evaluated before loop body
3. Increment, executed after loop body

Comparing For and While Counting Loops

Char class is deined by single quote, e.g. 'a', '1'...
